description: For this project, I was responsible for migrating content from an old website to a new platform. 
I also updated the component versions and the PHP version to ensure optimal performance and security.
As part of the upgrade, I mounted a new theme, which required significant customization to maintain the website's brand identity.
Throughout the migration process, I made sure that all website links stayed the same, 
which was crucial to avoid broken links and preserve the site's SEO rankings.
