description: For this project, I developed a custom WordPress plugin that enables users to reserve time slots for specific activities, such as classes or appointments. The plugin includes a grid layout that allows users to view available slots and select the ones they want. To make the reservation process seamless and secure, I integrated the plugin with Paysera, a popular payment gateway. This allows users to pay for their reservations online, providing a convenient and reliable payment method. Additionally, I integrated the plugin with email notifications to keep users informed about their reservations. Users receive confirmation emails after making a reservation, as well as reminders before the scheduled activity.
