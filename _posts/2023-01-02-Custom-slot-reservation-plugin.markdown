description: For this project, I developed a custom WordPress plugin that allows users to reserve time slots for specific activities, such as classes or appointments. The plugin features a grid layout that displays available slots and enables users to select their preferred ones. To facilitate secure and efficient payment processing, I integrated the plugin with Paysera, a popular payment gateway that accepts a variety of payment methods. Users can easily pay for their reservations using this integrated payment system. I also integrated the plugin with email notifications to keep users informed about their reservations. Users receive confirmation emails after making a reservation, as well as reminders before the scheduled activity. In addition to email notifications, I integrated the plugin with Twilio, a communication API, to send SMS reminders to users, providing an additional layer of engagement and convenience.
