description: In pursuit of becoming a proficient developer, I embarked on a project aimed at expanding my knowledge of Symfony, project design best practices, and API integration. To achieve this, I built a web application from scratch that implemented Symfony and integrated various APIs. During the project, I researched best practices in project design and applied them to my work. Through this project, I gained practical experience and deeper insights into Symfony, project design, and API integration, which I believe will be valuable in future projects. <a href="https://github.com/Qpsa/Symfony-chat">GitHub</a>
